# Experiments

## What is this?

To put it simply, it's just the place where all my "unprofessional" projects live.

## What do you mean by unprofessional?

Usually, I review my code line by line to see that:

- I didn't do any typo.
- the imports and exports are sorted by their supposed priority (determined by my mind).
- ...

This is my way to:

- try to be less perfectionist.
- learn new things without being worried about it not being perfect.

And probably something more that I don't remember right now.
